# Case-Study-Analyzing-Job-Market-Data-in-Power-BI

Explored a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. Used Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. Then used **DAX** to build insightful visualizations of your findings. Finally, bring it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to **create a business dashboard** so that we can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

**Business Dashboard (in PDF) includes :**

**1- Home & Jobs Overview**

**2- Skills Overview**

**3- Company Overview**
